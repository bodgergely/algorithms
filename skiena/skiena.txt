G = (V, E) => Graph is a set of vertices and a set of edges (vertex pairs)
    - V: set of vertices
    - E: set of edges - edge is a pair of vertices

They can represent relationships. Many algorithmic problems can be solved by thinking of them as graphs.
Do not try to invent new graph algos instead model the problem so you can use existing graph algorithms!
It is more important to recognise graph algo problems so know when to use which algo. No need to know the exact details.
Advanced algos:
    - find minimum spanning trees
    - shortest paths
    - network flows
Importance of correctly modeling the problem!

G = (V, E) set of vertices and set of edges of ordered or unordered pairs of vertices from V.##
###############################################################################################
Types:
    - Directed vs Undirected:
        if (x,y) is in E then (y,x) is too implicitely.
    - Weighted vs Unweighted:
    - Simple vs non-simple: non-simple: self-loop and multiedge ((x,y) is present multiple times)
    - Sparse vs Dense: sparse graphs have linear number of edges, dense graphs have quadratic dense is when close to n choose 2 number edges are
    - Cyclic vs Acyclic: acyclic when the graph does not contain any cycles. 
        - Trees are acyclic undirected graphs - recursive structures as cutting any edge leaves us with 2 smaller trees.
        - DAG - directd acyclic graphs are - scheduling problems where (x, y) means x must happen before y
                - Topological sorting will order the vertices to respect the precedence constrains. 
    - Embedded vs Topological:
        embedded : edges and vertices are assigned geometric positions
    - Implicit vs Explicit: implicit means we build them as we use them - example: backtrack search - vertices are the states and edges are as we move between them. usually no need to store the whole graph and no need to construct it before the analysis. 
    - Labled vs Unlabeled

Degree of vertex: number of edges it has

Data structures:
    - Adjacency matrix: n x m matrix M where M[i][j] = 1 if edge from i to j
            - rapid edge lookup, insertion and deletion
            - excessive space if the graph is sparse
    - Adjacency list:
            - less memory on average
Most of the time use Adjacency lists!

#define MAXV 1000           // max number of vertices

typdef struct edgenode
{
    int y;                  // label
    int weight;             // weight
    struct edgenode* next;  // next edge in list    
} edgenode;

typedef struct graph
{
    edgenode* edges[MAXV + 1];   // adjacency info
    int degree[MAXV + 1];       // outdegree of each vertex
    int nvertices;              // number of vertices in the graph
    int nedges;                 // number of edges in the graph
    bool directed;              // is the graph directed?
} graph;

(x, y) edge will be an edgenode 'y' in edgenode 'x' adj list
if undirected then (y,x) will also be placed: edgenode 'y' in its adj list has edgenode 'x'

Breadth-first Search (BFS):
    - Each node and edge will be discovered in the connected component.
    - Each vertex will have one parent (from where it was discovered from)
    - unweighted case: shortest path to every node

BFS(G, s)
    for each vertex u in V[G] - {s} do
        state[u] = "undiscovered"
        p[u] = nil  // no parent yet
    state[s] = "discovered"
    p[s] = nil
    Q = {s}
    while Q not empty:
        u = dequeue(Q)
        process_vertex_as_desired(u)
        for v in Adj(u):
            process_edge_as_desired((u,v))
            if state[v] == "undiscovered":
                state[v] = "discovered"
                p[v] = u
                enqueue(Q, v)
        state[v] = "processed"

bool processed[MAXV + 1];
bool discovered[MAXV + 1];
int parent[MAXV + 1];

void initialize_search(graph* g)
{
    int i;
    for(int i=1;i<g->nvertices;i++){
        processed[i] = discovered[i] = FALSE;
        parent[i] = -1;
    }
}
  
void bfs(graph* g, int start)
{
    queue q;    // queue of vertices to visit
    int v;      // current vertex
    int y;      // successor vertex
    edgenode* p;    // temp pointer
    
    init_queue(&q);
    enqueue(&q, start);
    discovered[start] = TRUE;

    while(empty_queue(&q) == FALSE){
        v = dequeue(&q);
        process_vertex_early(v);
        processed[v] = TRUE;
        p = g->edges[v];
        while(p != NULL){
            y = p->y;
            if((processed[y] == FALSE) || g->directed)
                process_edge(v, y);
            if(discovered[y] == FALSE){
                enqueue(&q, y);
                discovered[y] = TRUE;
                parent[y] = v;
            }
            p = p->next;
        }
        process_vertex_late(v);
    }
}

Connected components:
    - Connected component of an undirected graph is the Maximal set of vertices such that there is a path between every pair of vertices. 
    - Components are seperate pieces of the graph meaning there is no connection between the pieces.
    
    Lots of complicated promblems can be reduced to finding or counting connected components. 
    Example: Testing whether a puzzle like Rubik's cube or 15 puzzle can be solved from a certain position is asking whether the graph of legal positions are connected. Finding connected components can be solved using BFS. 

Vertex coloring:
    - No two adjacent vertices can have the same color. Each edge must have two different colored vertex.


DEPTH FIRST SEARCH:

We use a STACK, LIFO data structure to store the discovered nodes. Quickly wanders away from the starting vertex. 
Implementation can be recursive or use a stack datastructure explicitely.

DFS(G, u)
    state[u] = "discovered"
    process_vertex(u)
    entry[u] = time
    time = time + 1
    for v in Adj(u):
        process_edge(u, v)
        if state[v] == "undiscovered":
            p[v] = u
            DFS(G, v)
    state[u] = "processed"
    exit[u] = time
    time = time + 1

void dfs(graph* g, int v)
{
    edgenode* p;
    int y;      // successor vertex
    
    if(finished) return;       // allow termination
    
    discovered[v] = TRUE;
    time = time + 1;
    entry_time[v] = time;
    process_vertex_early(v);
    p = g->edges[v];
    while(p != NULL){
        y = p->y;
        if(discovered[y] == FALSE){
            parent[y] = v;
            process_edge(v, y);
            dfs(g, y);
        }
        else if((!processed[y]) || g->directed){
            process_edge(v, y);
        }

        if(finished) return;
        p = p->next;
    }
    process_vertex_late(v);
    time = time + 1;
    exit_time[v] = time;
    processed[v] = TRUE;
}

Depth first search is like backtracking - exhaustively searching if possible and backing up if there is no unexpored vertices left from the current node. Both are easy to implement and understand with recursion.

Take Home: DFS organizes vertices by entry/exit times and edges into trees and back edges. This is what gives DFS its real power.

Applications of DFS:
    - Cycle detection: back edges are the key to find the cycles. If there is no back edges then all edges are tree edges so there are o cycles. Any back edge from x to an ancestor y creates a cycle. 
        void process_edge(int x, int y)
    - Articulation vertex(or cut node) finding: a single vertex whose deletion disconnects a connected component of a graph. Brute force detection: Temporarely delete a node and test with BFS or DFS if all nodes are still reachable. O(n(n+m)). There a linear alog with dfs that tests all nodes in a single dfs. 
        Skiena, page 174-175
        - root cut nodes
        - bridge cut nodes
        - parent cut nodes

Bridge edge: (x,y) tree edge is a bridge if no back edge from y and below connect back to y or above.

#########  DAG Topological Sort  ##########
Directed Acyclic Graph - > Order the vertices from left to right on a line to traverse all nodes. You can only do this on acyclic graphs.
    Each DAG has at least one topological sort. It gives us an ordering to process each vertex before any of its successors. It gives you a scheduling of jobs for instance. X needs to happen before Y.
